# ** Bike Distribution Analysis Dashboard**

## Introduction:
This project delves into the usage patterns, station logistics, and weather temperatures that influence the New York Citi Bike sharing system to uncover distribution inefficiencies of bike rentals with the aim of circumventing availability issues. By examining January to December 2022 bike trip and weather data, I used pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze:
* Station activity, 
* Trip duration,
* User profiles, 
* Weather temperatures impacting demand.

With it, the relevant logistic issues were presented in the interactive charts using Plotly and Kepler.gl and designed with Streamlit on the final dashboard.

## Analysis Objective:
Uncover distribution inefficiencies based on rental patterns to circumvent availability issues.
